He LOVED going to the lake every year when we were kids though. The water wasn‚Äôt particularly clear but the waves were small and he could float around in the shallow water.

BUT he did have one thing going for him, he was damn good at holding his breath. A big, heavyset guy, he found a really great way (HAHAHAHa) to terrorize his kids by diving quietly underwater, gliding along till he could see us standing or playing in the water then yanking our legs out from under us. Because of his breath holding ability, he could be quite a few yards away when he started his sneak attacks and if you were not on HIGH ALERT since Dad was in the water, don‚Äôt come up crying if you get dunked.

I sort of loved my dad but at the lake he was just another asshole. Only my brother became a strong swimmer (despite the fact we had an public pool in our neighborhood) and that‚Äôs just because his friends got him out swimming in his teens, when DadShark wasn‚Äôt around.",0.9075,1

So, while your fear is valid, therapy is scary for everyone.. and it‚Äôs not a great reason to not go. If you are against getting yourself help, then you should refrain from getting involved in relationships until you aren‚Äôt, because you will absolutely continue to hurt other people. 

Remember- your life lessons are someone else‚Äôs trauma.

Instead of asking for people to pray for someone to forgive you, you need to actually do the hard work to not be someone who is always needing forgiveness for treating others poorly. It‚Äôs a hard pill to swallow but swallow it you must.",-0.6574,1

I can't motivate her and she can't motivate me, so yeah, I'd definitely like to have someone more outgoing by my side.

You can and it's easy to have a relationship that way. You just can't be toxic.

The reason that type of relationship doesn't work sometimes is because of one of them being a narcissist and manipulative. Things that are not healthy for any relationship.

Source: I've only ever dated 1 person who was not Depressed or Anxious and they were super toxic.

My wife and I both have depression and anxiety. It's the healthiest relationship I've ever been in. And by us both experiencing it? I know exactly the signs of ""okay, it's time we get outta this event."" Because her social meter is done. It's her telling me ""Hey when work is done, let's go do X."" Because I'm over stressing with work and she knows exactly what can help.

That's actually why water feels colder than air of the same temperature.

comment,i2tz92t,2s5ti,meirl,false,1648724187,https://old.reddit.com/r/meirl/comments/tss0l9/me_irl/i2tz92t/,"Idk about that, I'm usually pretty laid-back and chill if I may say so myself and I've always been looking for someone similar to me in that regard. Been in relationships with people who would in theory balance things out and it's totally not for me.

In general, uncomfortable situations are rare - maybe it's a mindset thing. I do evaluate if it's worth complaining about something or being honest with a stranger, but most of the time I just go for it. Worst case, I need to explain myself. Being polite about it and open for compromise usually solves many issues easily.

Complaints can be constructive too with the proper wording. Some people have this special complaint voice and/or being passive aggressive - that makes me much more uncomfortable tbh. Making a big deal out of a minor mistake and maybe also trying to profit off it also has been a major turn-off for me. I'm not here to haggle and exploit a situation to my advantage - I want to have dinner in peace and maybe establish a long-term relationship with the owner if I like the place. I'd rather get free drinks 5 years down the road because I'm a welcome guest vs. insisting on my order and trying to extort a free meal because the kitchen made a mistake.

If I've learned anything during the past 40 years, it pays off to be patient and forthcoming, both as a customer and an employee. Mistakes happen all the time and communicating in a calm manner always has been a good strategy.

Regarding situations that are just about talking to strangers, no malintent or exploitative strategy: that one I can fully understand. But I've also realized that relying on your partner to do these things for you isn't going to solve the underlying issues and there always will be situations that need taken care all by yourself. 

If you struggle to order pizza or talk to the cab driver, it's obviously nice to have someone in charge of these things in your life - but it will get increasingly difficult for yourself to face these situations if you never engage. Your partner should be your backup imho.

I know it can be very difficult, I've been there but long-term it's not healthy.",0.8867,5
